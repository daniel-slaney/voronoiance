TODO

- Some actors need specific values, e.g. slime needs a lifetime
  - Some form of components maybe...
  - Sod it, just fill actor with crap because time constraints!

- need to spawn monsters

- Leapers
- Slugs
- Bomb guys (copied from Hoplite)
- Maybe something that messes with FoW
- Siren from DCSS that limits player movement
- Gassy zombie?

- FoW (Fog of War) and FoV (Field of View)
  - seen vertices
    - how to draw them as fogged?
      - assign FoV and seen colours
      - some general technique.
  - in view vertices
  - see through walls?
    - ideally one deep, use edgeFilteredDistanceMap()

- rendering
  - want to be able to draw things that cross over the edge of FoV
    - for example a monster walking into view shouldn;t just appear.
  - solutions
    - draw over unseen cells with black at the end of other rendering but
      before GUI
      - what about seen but not in FoV cells?
      - especially if they have effects on them.
    - stencil out for things in FoV
      - not sure about efficiency
      - well for symbol actors but slime?
      - don't want to implement remembering cell contents if possible.

- leapers
  - leap action
  - bounce action
    - needs to set an fx every frame while bouncing
    - can we re-use the plan logic?
      - probably not directly but the code will be similar.
- slugs
  - needs to spawn slime when it dies.
  - slime
    - dropping slime actors
      - render slime
      - slime needs a lifetime
    - impeading movement of certain actors, e.g. everything except slugs
      - need struggle/entangled action if you try and move when you can't
    - rendering
      - could change colour of tile
      - render a screen space texture using stencils
- bombers
  - throw action
  - explode action
  - push action (for shield bash) (takes the place of search or rest)



- Help screen text
- End game screen
  - Maybe some stats...
- Splash screen
  - Display over the game and fade out for the first few seconds.
