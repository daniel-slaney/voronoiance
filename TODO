TODO

- Need actions
  - spawn, move, attack, leap and so on.
    - spawn: renderable, layer, position
    - move: actor, position (assume the same layer, must be nearby)
    - teleport actor, position (can be anywhere)
  - Animation and gameState changing separate
    - What about spawning mid animation, e.g. for slime
      - Could force it to be at the end of an animation.
      - Could display a temporary surrogate.
  - Actions can 'block' or not.
    - Blocking actions are animated on their own.
    - Non-blocking actions can be run in parallel
    - Should end up being the same as Shiren's system.
- How to get inputs to the player?
  - Need a specifc buffer or storage in GameState

- How to support directional keys?
  - For each direction assign the closest edge
    - Can have the same edge for more than one dir
  - For each edge assign closest direction
    - Can have the same direction for multiple edges
  - First assign edges closest to the direction
    - For any remining edges see if another direction will work.

- Some actors need specific values, e.g. slime needs a lifetime


- Offset actor (for anims)
- Colour cell (for slime)
- Show symbol or image (for spear)


- Leapers
- Slugs
- Bomb guys (copied from Hoplite)
- Maybe something that messes with FoW
- Siren from DCSS that limits player movement
- Gassy zombie?
